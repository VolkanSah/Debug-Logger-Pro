A professional WordPress tool that is more than just a debug logger.

### The Problem with Traditional Loggers

Many debug tools are bloated, miss critical errors, and fail to provide real-time insights. You're often left in the dark, especially when a fatal error crashes your site.

### The Solution: The Enhanced Debug Logger Plugin

This plugin was built for developers who need clear, fast, and reliable insight into their WordPress instance. It's a `Debug Bar`, an `Observer Server`, and a `security tool` all in one.

### What it does:
* **Catches Fatal Errors:** Detects and logs PHP errors that crash your site.
* **Logs Attacks:** Records requests from bots and "wannabe" hackers scanning for vulnerabilities.
* **Consolidates Your Logs:** Combines standard WordPress logs (`debug.log`) with your custom messages.
* **Always Visible:** A floating console provides real-time insights directly on the page.
* **Minimalist:** Slim, bloat-free, and optimized for performance.

### Installation

1.  Download the plugin.
2.  Upload it via `Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin` and activate it.
3.  Go to `Tools > Debug Logger Pro` to get started.
